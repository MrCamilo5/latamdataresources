# Disclaimer & Purpose

This repository contains a selection of data, data-plumbing recipes and data-cleaning scripts for working with  **Latin American Open Data Sources**. The main objective of this repository is to serve as a resource and inspiration of raw material for building data products.

Due to the nature of the data sources (most of them contain data from Latin America) and the fact that this is work in progress, you will very likely encounter variable names and some descriptions in spanish. Do not panic!: Google translate is your friend!

I hope you use it to build data products that can tell fascinating stories about Colombia and Latin America.

# Project Ideas

- Are science and technology contracts being fairly assigned in Colombia in the past few years?
- Which research groups are getting the most funding? Do they have ties to a specific university?
- Which geographical regions produce better quality research institutions?
- Is the government effort in reducing the number of anti-personnel mines in Colombia effective? 
- What's the historical evolution of landmine disabling per region?
